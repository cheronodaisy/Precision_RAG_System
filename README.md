# Precision RAG: Prompt Tuning For Building Enterprise Grade RAG System

This project focuses on creating a robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system through precise prompt tuning.
## Services

### Automatic Prompt Generation Service
This service streamlines the process of creating effective prompts, enabling businesses to efficiently utilize large language models (LLMs) for generating high-quality, relevant content. It significantly reduces the time and expertise required in crafting prompts manually.

### Automatic Evaluation Data Generation Service
This service automates the generation of diverse test cases, ensuring comprehensive coverage and identifying potential issues. This enhances the reliability and performance of LLM applications, saving significant time in the quality assurance (QA) process.

### Prompt Testing and Ranking Service
This service evaluates and ranks different prompts based on their effectiveness. It helps users achieve the desired outcomes from LLMs by ensuring that chatbots and virtual assistants provide accurate, contextually relevant responses. This, in turn, improves user engagement and satisfaction.
